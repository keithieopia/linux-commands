> tweak, optimize, and secure linux

A collection of guides for Linux on topics that I found myself constantly
researching. Hopefully this will save the reader time trying to digest all the
material available on these subjects.


## Table of Contents

* [Firefox](https://github.com/keithieopia/bin/blob/master/firefox.md): secure,
de-bloat, add-ons, ad-block filters, and about:config tweaks
* [Full Disk Encryption](https://github.com/keithieopia/bin/blob/master/full-disk-encryption.md):
secure, yet sane settings for those confused about FDE on Linux


## A Note on "GNU/Linux"
These guides do not follow the "GNU/Linux" naming convention. It is my opinion
that typing out GNU/Linux feels pedantic and overtly verbose.

Technically Linux is just a kernel, but it's understood by most to imply more:
the kernel, GNU coreutils, bsdutils, systemD, and everything else that makes up
a standard Linux distribution.

Because of this consensus, I see no confusion that would warrant further
elaboration. The Free Software Foundation and it's founder Richard Stallman's
contributions to the Linux community are greatly appreciated.
